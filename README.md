# ShellLink ([NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) plugin)
It allows you to perform complex operations with shortcut files (`.lnk`)<br>
The plugin is included in my **unofficial** [NSIS builds](https://github.com/negrutiu/nsis)

This is a clone of the original project created by **Angelo Mandato**<br>
